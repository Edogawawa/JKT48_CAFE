                <p>Katsu curry is a popular dish in Japanese cuisine, which consists of a meat or seafood cutlet that is breaded and deep-fried, and is served with a thick curry sauce. The cutlet is typically made from pork (tonkatsu) or chicken (chicken katsu) and the breading is made from flour, egg, and bread crumbs. The curry sauce is typically made with a roux base and various spices, such as turmeric, cumin, and coriander. The dish is usually served with rice, vegetables, and a salad. Katsu curry is considered to be a Japanese adaptation of the dish "cutlet curry" which was introduced to Japan in the late 19th century by the British.</p>
                <p>Ingredients:</p>
                <p>- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts or pork cutlets</p>
                <p>- 1 cup flour</p>
                <p>- 2 eggs</p>
                <p>- 2 cups panko bread crumbs</p>
                <p>- Vegetable oil for frying</p>
                <p>- Salt and pepper</p>
                <p>- 1 onion, finely chopped</p>
                <p>- 1 carrot, finely chopped</p>
                <p>- 2 cloves of garlic, minced</p>
                <p>- 2 tbsp curry powder</p>
                <p>- 1 can of coconut milk</p>
                <p>- 1 cup chicken or vegetable broth</p>
                <p>- 1 tsp honey</p>
                <p>- 1 tsp soy sauce</p>
                <p>- Cooked rice for serving</p>

                <p>
                    Instructions:
                </p>
                <p>1. Season the chicken or pork cutlets with salt and pepper.</p>
                <p>2. Place the flour, eggs, and panko bread crumbs in separate shallow dishes. Dip the chicken or pork cutlets in the flour, then the eggs, and finally the panko bread crumbs, pressing the bread crumbs onto the meat to adhere.</p>
                <p>3. Heat enough vegetable oil in a deep frying pan to come 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan. Fry the chicken or pork cutlets in batches until golden brown and cooked through, about 3-4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.</p>
                <p>4. In a separate pan, heat some oil and saut√© the onion, carrot, and garlic until softened.</p>
                <p>5. Add the curry powder and stir for another minute.</p>
                <p>6. Add the coconut milk, broth, honey, and soy sauce. Bring to a simmer and let it cook for about 10 minutes.</p>
                <p>7. Cut the chicken or pork cutlets into thin slices and serve over rice.</p>
                <p>8. Pour curry sauce over the chicken or pork and garnish with chopped parsley or cilantro.</p>
