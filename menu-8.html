                    Ingredients:
                </p>
                <p>
                    - 3 cups of all-purpose flour
                </p>
                <p>- 1 envelope of active dry yeast</p>
                <p>- 1 teaspoon of sugar</p>
                <p>- 1 teaspoon of salt</p>
                <p>- 1 cup of warm water</p>
                <p>- 2 tablespoons of olive oil</p>

                <p>
                    Instructions:
                </p>
                <p>1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and salt.</p>
                <p>2. In a separate small bowl, mix together the warm water and olive oil.</p>
                <p>3. Slowly pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix with a spoon or a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment.</p>
                <p>4. Once the dough comes together, knead it by hand on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes or until it becomes smooth and elastic.</p>
                <p>5. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.</p>
                <p>6. Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air, and divide it into 2 or 3 equal portions.</p>
                <p>7. Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness, usually around 1/4 inch.</p>
                <p>8. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C)</p>
                <p>9. Place the dough on a baking sheet or pizza pan.</p>
                <p>10. Add your desired toppings, such as tomato sauce, cheese, and any additional toppings.</p>
                <p>11. Bake in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.</p>
                <p>12. Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
